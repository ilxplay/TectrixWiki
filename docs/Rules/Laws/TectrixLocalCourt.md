**3.1** A so-called "complaint" is a legal action that you took against another Tectrix member for committing an unlawful action against you or another server member.

- **3.1.1** Submitting a complaint through a ticket means you have sent it to the Server Attorney, who will decide what legal or lawful action to take in response. The Server Attorney will likely address your legal request by scheduling a court appointment on a mutually agreed-upon date.

- **3.1.2** Absence from court due to medical or other emergencies is not punishable. In such cases, a new appointment will be scheduled.

- **3.1.3** Absence from court without a valid excuse is punishable, you may get a warning and typically the case will not be automatically suspended.

**3.2** The complaint must include legitimate proof of unlawful actions committed by the server member. It should also contain your Minecraft and Discord name/nickname, along with a detailed description of the entire situation.

**3.3** Within seven days of receiving the complaint, the Server Attorney will contact you for a possible date for the first local court hearing. If there is still an opportunity for both parties to solve the issue, without a Tectrix Local Court (*TLC*) Server Attorney will find an option.

	-   **3.4.3.1** The person you invite as a helper is not allowed, to speak for you, interfere in any way with the proceedings, and sign documents on your behalf.

**3.5** A so-called "Local class action" is when one or several individuals (*class representatives*) file a lawsuit on behalf of a larger group of people who have similar legal claims. This type of lawsuit allows individuals who may not have the resources to file individual claims to join together and seek legal relief as a collective group, or "class."

- **3.5.1** A reason for initiating a local class action must be related to events that occurred within the Tectrix Minecraft server and should not have a significant impact on the Tectrix Discord community.
