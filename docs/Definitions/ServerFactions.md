# Server Factions

## General

The server factions are the type of organizations curated by the server administration. 
Everyone can be a leader of such a faction and implement their own changes, to faction mechanics or policies.

- Server factions are a significant part of the Tectrix thus can not be removed.

- Major changes to the server factions always need to be first approved by Tectrix owner and Administrators.
